## Syracuse University Chapter of The Society of Physics Students (SUSPS)

SU SPS strives to enrich the undergraduate experience of its members and help them prepare for careers in physics or related fields. We organize several academic events, such as undergraduate-level faculty talks, group study sessions, review sessions for first-year physics courses, and visits to nearby universities to tour their physics departments. We organize several outreach activities as well, having participated in numerous science fairs by judging or doing physics demonstrations, and we have made several visits to local high schools to talk about the value and versatility of an undergraduate degree in physics. We also organize a wide range of social activities, including potlucks, movie nights, barbecues, and many others. Other information about our club: - We welcome anyone with an interest in physics, not just physics majors - Membership is completely free! - Participation in all of our events is free as well!. It's important to us that none of our members be limited in their participation by financial issues.
